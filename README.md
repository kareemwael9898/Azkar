# Azkar App

## Overview
The Azkar app is designed to help Muslims keep track of their daily Azkar (remembrances) and Tasbeeh in a convenient and interactive way.
The app allows users to view and interact with a list of Azkar based on different categories, such as evening, morning, and prayer-related Azkar.

🌟 𝗠𝗮𝗶𝗻 𝗙𝗲𝗮𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲𝘀:
- Written in Java for robust performance
- RecyclerView integration to enhance performance and prevent lag
- Morning and evening remembrances, plus remembrances after prayer
- Sound effects to enhance the user experience
- Snackbar notifications to show the remaining count of remembrances

This app is perfect for anyone looking to maintain their daily prayers and remembrances effortlessly.

Developing this app was a great learning experience, especially optimizing performance with RecyclerView and providing a seamless user experience with Snackbar notifications.

I am grateful for the support and knowledge gained through **Digital Egypt Pioneers Initiative - DEPI** in my mobile application development journey.

Stay tuned for more features and updates coming soon!
